# My Life In Months

Inspired by [sharlagelfand](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/mylifeinmonths) (in turn inspired by [Isabella Benabaye](https://isabella-b.com/blog/my-life-in-months/))


I couldn't get `waffle` to work, so I use `ggwaffle` instead! 

I also don't have the patience for all those lovely annotations - but should really work something out since that legend is too small


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("life_in_months.png")
```
